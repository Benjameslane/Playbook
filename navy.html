            <ul>
                <li><strong>Inside Veer:</strong> A classic triple option play where the quarterback reads the defensive end to decide whether to hand off to the fullback, keep the ball, or pitch to the trailing back.</li>
                <li><strong>Midline Option:</strong> Similar to the Inside Veer but with a read on the defensive tackle instead, creating additional inside running lanes.</li>
                <li><strong>Outside Veer:</strong> An option play that targets the perimeter, stretching the defense horizontally and creating opportunities for big gains.</li>
                <li><strong>Counter Option:</strong> A misdirection play that starts like the Inside Veer but reverses direction to catch the defense off guard.</li>
