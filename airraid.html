        <h1 class="airraid-title">Air Raid Offense</h1>

        <section class="airraid-introduction">
            <h2 class="airraid-section-title">Introduction</h2>
            <p>The Air Raid offense, pioneered by the innovative mind of Mike Leach, has revolutionized college football. His approach to simplifying the game and emphasizing execution has made this offense one of the most effective and widely adopted systems in the sport.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="airraid-philosophy">
            <h2 class="airraid-section-title">Philosophy of the Air Raid</h2>
            <p>The Air Raid offense is built on the philosophy of mastering simple concepts and executing them to perfection. It's about repetition, consistency, and making the most out of straightforward plays.</p>
            <h3>Pros and Cons</h3>
            <p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>High-scoring potential</li>
                <li>Simplifies decision-making for players</li>
                <li>Adaptable to different player strengths</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Can be predictable if not varied</li>
                <li>Requires precise execution</li>
                <li>Relies heavily on the passing game, which can be affected by weather conditions</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Keeping this scheme as simple as possible is crucial. The Air Raid is about mastering simple concepts and executing them early and often.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="airraid-formations">
            <h2 class="airraid-section-title">Formations</h2>
            <p>In the Air Raid offense, formations are kept simple to maximize execution and versatility. The three primary formations used are 2x2 (Ace Right/Left), 3x1 (Early/Late), and 3x2 (Spread).</p>
            <h3>Formation Details</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>2x2 (Ace Right/Left or Spread):</strong> This is our base formation, providing a balanced look that can easily transition into various play types.</li>
                <li><strong>3x1 (Early/Late or Trey Open):</strong> This formation puts three receivers on one side, creating mismatches and spreading the defense thin.</li>
                <li><strong>3x2 (Spread):</strong> This formation maximizes the spread concept, using five receivers to stress the defense horizontally.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="airraid-base-plays">
            <h2 class="airraid-section-title">Base Plays</h2>
            <p>The key to the Air Raid offense is a set of base plays that are simple yet highly effective. These plays form the foundation of the offense, allowing for consistency and mastery.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>92 (Mesh):</strong> The Mesh concept involves two receivers running crossing routes underneath, creating natural picks and mismatches.</li>
                <li><strong>618 (Stick):</strong> The Stick play is a quick-hitting concept designed to exploit short zones and provide an easy read for the quarterback.</li>
                <li><strong>91 (Shallow Cross):</strong> The Shallow Cross involves a shallow drag route across the field, giving the quarterback a quick option against man or zone coverage.</li>
                <li><strong>6 (Four Verticals):</strong> Four Verticals is a deep passing concept with all four receivers running vertical routes to stretch the defense vertically.</li>
                <li><strong>95 (Y-Cross):</strong> The Y-Cross play involves the Y receiver running a deep crossing route, often creating big play opportunities against various coverages.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="airraid-run-game">
            <h2 class="airraid-section-title">The Run Game</h2>
            <p>In the Air Raid offense, the traditional run game is often replaced with RPOs (Run-Pass Options) and screens. These plays keep the defense off balance and complement the passing attack.</p>
            <h3>Screen Plays</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Early/Late Ram/Lion (Trey Open Cross Screen):</strong> Fast-hitting screens designed to quickly get the ball to the receiver in space.</li>
                <li><strong>Ace Randy/Larry (Spread WR Screen):</strong> Utilizes wide receiver screens to attack the perimeter.</li>
                <li><strong>Early Rita/Lisa (Slow Screen) or Trey Open WR Mid Screen:</strong> Slow-developing screens that act as change-ups to stagger the defense's timing.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>RPO Plays</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Early Trey Open HB Strong RPO Peek Hitch (Y-Stick):</strong> An RPO that pairs a run option with the Y-Stick concept, giving the quarterback multiple reads.</li>
                <li><strong>Spread RPO Peek Slant:</strong> Combines the inside run with a quick slant, allowing for flexibility based on defensive alignment.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="airraid-base-plays-details">
            <h2 class="airraid-section-title">Base Play Details</h2>
            <p>These will be our base plays. I will add more options down the road along with more "2nd and short big shot plays" and red zone zone options </p>
            <div class="airraid-play">
                <h3>92 (Mesh)</h3>
                <img src="./assets/mesh.png" alt="92 Mesh Play Diagram" class="play-diagram">
                <p>QB Reads: Look for the softest corner and attacks that side. Work eyes from Z-H-F. The OLB to the playside will tell you what to do with the ball. If the OLB bails to the corner, throw the shallow or the swing. If the OLB sits, Throw the corner in rhythm or the swing. If the OLB flies to the swing, throw the corner in rhythm or the shallow.

                    Z post is the most common tag on 92. This is great tag to attack single high defenses. The Z will run a post that can flatten out if the middle field safety bails deep. The QB has his eyes on the Sam and will bang the post behind him if he flies to the flat or sits on the mesh. </p>

                <img src="./assets/stick.png" alt="618 Stick Play Diagram" class="play-diagram">
                <p>QB Reads: Check slant side first. The QB must commit to a side. They can throw either side of the formation based on leverage. Read the flat defender stick to shoot. Remember space and leverage. Can throw the Post Vs. 2 high or throw the wheel vs 1 high.</p>

                <img src="./assets/shallow.png" alt="91 Shallow Cross Play Diagram" class="play-diagram">
                <p>QB Reads: Read shallow-dig-F. In a two deep shell, look for the safety to attack the dig in order to hit the post</p>
                <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2u0xnMmZz44?si=8Ig3s7skm_jU2x8P" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

                <h3>6 (Four Verticals)</h3>
                <img src="./assets/verts.png" alt="6 Four Verticals Play Diagram" class="play-diagram">
                <p>2x2 Rules:
                    <br>

                    Everything is determined by leverage
                    Look for press corners first
                    Read outside - inside - F
                    If no corner is pressed, check to a tagged route on best match-up.
                    <br>
                    3x1 Rules:
                    <br>
                    
                    Look for a pressed corner or a tagged route based on leverage
                    Read Y - H - F
                    <br>
                    The QB MUST COMMIT to a side once he has made his decision. Be decisive, and confident!
                    <br>
                    F checks his release and settles in the middle of the field that the LB's have vacated. He can be put on either side of the QB depending on pass protection.</p>

                <h3>95 (Y-Cross)</h3>
                <img src="./assets/y cross.png" alt="95 Y-Cross Play Diagram" class="play-diagram">
                <p>QB Reads: Read vertical-out-Cross-dig.  

                    95 out of 3x1 is a good switch up from 2x2. The corner dig route behind the cross is almost always open against 2 high defenses. The quick out to the play side can be a good look against man coverage.
